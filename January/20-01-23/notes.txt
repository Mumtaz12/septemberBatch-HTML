Display:grid
//it is 2d (dimension) property.
Steps to be followed.
1.we need to segragate into different blocks.
example;
header,footer,sidebar,banner,main
2.we need to give grid-area for all the blocks 
example:
.header{grid-area:header;}
3.we need to give following things inside the parent container
example:
display:grid 
gap:50px; it will give margin between the sections 
  grid-template-areas: 'header'
            'main'
            'footer';
//it will create the sections into multiple rows and columns
//each row should have equal number of columns
//if we have different columns names in one row in another rows you can use the same column to extend the width of that paritcular area.
